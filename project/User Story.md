# User story

## As a music fan

## I want to find the top 10 songs on spotify/soundcloud easily through opening a single webpage

## So that I can listen to these songs OR play their video clips 

-----

## Opening Screen
As a new user i want to see a default top 10 list in the middle of the page and a search bar to the left so I can visualise the possibilities

Search items will be on the left and will include 
- search by genre
- search by location

Found top ten list will be displayed with at least chart position, Artist and Track names.
Additionally we can add other info such as previous chart position, album thumbnail art etc

Selecting one of the tracks will open a panel on the right which will display a video and/or audio and/or album art etc and comprehensive information on the artist and track. The video or song can be in a frame that might/will play

## Login Screen
This might be necesary for configuring API login information

## Favourites 
<p>Below the search section, the user will have a "favourites" section which can be broken down into:
- Favourite genres
- Favourite locations
These should be collapsible lists, but as a default be open. When closed a turning arrow can be shown.

Clicking onto any of the favourites buttons will initiate a search using the parameters.

## Preferences
A users last choice of search should be saved locally so that when they come back to the page, the search will refresh
